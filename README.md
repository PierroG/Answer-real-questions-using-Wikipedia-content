# Ask.me : Question Answering using BERT and Wikipedia

Student exploration of Question Answering.

Our project aims to answer general knowledge questions by using a BERT model pretrained on SQuAD.

The pipeline can be summed-up in 3 essential steps : 
- Subject extraction
- Wikipedia article retrieval
- Answer extraction 

Our code is functional and we deployed a web app that can be accessed here : https://ask-me.azurewebsites.net/
