# Ask.me : Question Answering using BERT and Wikipedia

Student exploration of Question Answering.

Our project aims to answer general knowledge questions by using Wikipedia data and the following BERT model pre-trained on SQuAD :<br/>
bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad.

this model is available here : https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad

## The pipeline

The pipeline can be summed-up in 3 essential steps : 

<ul>
    <li>Subject extraction</li>
    <li>Wikipedia article retrieval</li>
    <li>Answer extraction </li>
</ul>
