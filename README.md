# Answer-real-questions-using-Wikipedia-content

Student exploration of a kaggle competition subject

The goal is to give to a question-answering model the best Wikipedia excerpt in which to search for an answer. 
Given a real human question, we should predict a relevant answer, retrieved from the given excerpt.

To do so, our main tasks are to work on how to detect the topic of a question and select the best Wikipedia article given that topic, and a relevant excerpt from this article.
